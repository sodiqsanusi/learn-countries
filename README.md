## Overview
The goal was to build a web app that allows users to check countries, search, and filter data from a dropdown. Had to integrate a 3rd party RESTful API, then manipulated the data gotten from the APIs endpoints. 

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the application depending on their device's screen size.
- See all countries from the API on the homepage.
- Search for a country using an `input` field.
- Filter countries by region.
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page.
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page.
- [x] Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process
I'm sure you're tired of hearing thisðŸ˜…, buh still I'm saying it. Mobile-first workflow, "Thinking in React" component architecture, and a lot of trial and error. Didn't have access to the design raw files in Figma and Sketch, so had to build based on what I could see in the design images, I tried tho.

### Built with
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/) - For making the react app navigatable.

### What I learned
Due to the amount of images used in the application, I decided to learn more on lazy-loading images for optimization and performance reasons. Also learnt some new CSS tricks also, CSS is so interesting and soo WIDE! 
Learnt on the `Object.keys()` JavaScript method also, this allows you to iterate over the keys of an object and I used this in getting parts of a fetch request I needed to make, didn't know an object was also iterable, JavaScript is nice too.

### Continued development
This may be my last web development project, planning to drop programming so I can focus on my studies. Will drop more updates on that.
If I still continue though, which isn't looking feasible at the moment, I'll love to move on with my skills by learning Next.js. Next is a React framework that'll enable me use Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). I pray I actually don't have to drop web devðŸ˜­ðŸ¥º, it has been lovely to meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­!

### Useful resources
- [Object.keys() - MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) - The MDN doc that helped me understand the `Object.keys()` method, check it out.
- [REST countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - I integrated data for the web app UI from this API. The API's response actually has a nice architecture that makes it easy for frontend teams to use and it also has this fantastic filter_Response query that can help specify the data you want per request, helpful for developers that don't know how to use GraphQL.
